# keychainbrute
Recover lost keychain passwords using a simple swift script (so can run natively on Mac or compile and be used in other tools).

Used the Ruby script at https://github.com/peterhil/keychainrecovery for the structure and a few ideas to speed up recovery (like allowing for entering parts of the password that are known) but this is in swift.
